My name is Frank Rousseau, I’m 33 years old and I've been a web addict for 19
years. I love using and understanding web applications as much as I enjoy
building them. I created my first website in 1997, it was a poetry registry.
Since then, I've never stopped. Watching, showing, sharing, learning, doing
with people from all over the world is not something you can give up easily.
It's something I want to experience forever.
</p>

<h3>Pro</h3>
<p>
About my professional activity, I was software engineer and business analyst.
Then I co-founded Cozy Cloud, a startup that built FOSS personal clouds. I was
the CTO of the company and grew the product and tech teams to 18 people. We
were a remote office team and we did free open source software, so we had to
manage the contributions from the community. I really enjoyed that
experience and learned a lot from it. I had to leave the company for sad
reasons, but the journey was unique.
<br />
<br />
Now, I provide freelancing services in these three areas:

<ul>
<li>Backend development (Node.js and Python mainly)</li>
<li>Agile methodologies</li>
<li>Engineering management</li>
</ul>

Feel free to contact me if you are interested.

<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>
In my spare time, I perform talks about Free and Open Source technologies. I
had the opportunity to speak at JDLL, RMLL, DotJS, ParisJS, LyonJS, NodeJS
Paris, Human Talks, Quantified Self Europe and Hy!  Berlin. <br />
Aside coding, I play the clarinet and I enjoy chilling into cool
bars and nice restaurants.
</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p>
Another thing I do is to share my thoughts about software development,
startups and self-hosting. You can read them on the following medias:

<h3>Inspirations</h3>

<p>
For my working activities, <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a>
and <a href="http://lawsofsimplicity.com/">The Laws of Simplicity</a> are a
great source of ideas. With their pragmatic frameworks, they help me to deal
with uncertainty and achieve goals.
</p>

<p>
When it's about building a team or a community I dig into 
<a href="http://www.davidmarquet.com/Books.html">Turn your ship around</a>
and the <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc130">chapter 6 of the
ZMQ guide</a>.
They give good tips about making people work well together and connect
their strengths.
</p>
  
<p>
I read a lot about personal development, but finally, when I need confidence
and courage I think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">
Naruto</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy">Luffy (One
Piece)</a>. They never give up and can see when people have something good
inside them.
When it's time to be a little bit cynic, glamourous and honest I turn to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Canardo">Canardo</a>. My last
discovery is the funny and humble <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man">One
Punch Man</a>. I like how he stays 
simple despite his super powers.

<p>
But overall, the text that resumes the best my way of living is 
<a href="http://9gag.com/gag/36806">The Life Manifesto</a>.
